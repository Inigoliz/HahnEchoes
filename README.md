# SpinEchoes
This code and the video linked below were developped as part of the Quantum Future Challenge
2020, hosted by Science at Home and the Danish Science Departments.

The code was written taking an inspiration from the Qiskit textbook and some other examples
found online, along with my own additions were the code was clumsy or difficukt to follow.

The code can be found at 'MeasuringDecoherence.ipynb', and a pdf describing further theoretical details at 'MeasuringDecoherence.pdf'.
